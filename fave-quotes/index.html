                <h2>Adrian Tchaikovsky: Walking to Aldebaran</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">I am the monster-killer. I am what the monsters in the dark are scared of, or would be if any of them had enough of a brain to be scared with. I am the thing the Crypts cannot kill, and something out there is fucking with me.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">It’s money, money can’t buy you love. Because it’s the root of all evil, or love of it is.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Time doesn’t care, time is relative and personal.</span></p>

                <h2>Adrian Tchaikovsky: Elder Race</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">The road to the Tower of Nyrgoth Elder is long and hard because he decreed it so,” Lyn recited. “That it not be trodden lightly by fools, but only by earnest heroes when the kingdom is threatened by dire sorcery.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">She was at the very portal to the sorcerer’s domain, where no other had ever stood since her ancestor had come, to beg the help of magic to fight magic. Just as she now needed to fight magic. She, the princess of the blood. The one whose duty it was to do such impossible things. Go to the forbidden places. Strike bargains with the unknowable.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">But there is enough in war and bad harvests without inventing a supernatural threat.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Surely one did not become a great sorcerer without making great enemies.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Such beasts hunt in secrecy; even their prey are loath to speak of them for fear of showing weakness.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">If you were going to lie then make it a big one.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I am going to make a momentous decision. Most likely it is a bad decision. Certainly it may be the last major decision I ever make. A terrible, bleak decision born of despair, surely. The decision only a man overcome by the beast that hunts him would make.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Sometimes you can’t get things done, with all that in the way. Sometimes sincerity has to take a back seat.</span></p>

                <h2>Andrew Rowe: How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">Father always told me that true heroism was when someone fought for what was right, regardless of the risk to themselves. But Father was wrong. True Heroism was a passive skill only available to the Hero class, unlocked forty-second level.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 1</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Sparring works to some degree, but just hitting someone with fire doesn’t get you much of a reward unless they’re significantly hurt... and that gets awkward.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 2</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I can’t just wait for some Hero to show up and save the world. I can’t just wait and watch while the world burns around me. There’s no telling how much will be left when the Hero rises. And even when he does arrive, he could fail. It’s happened.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 3</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Trial and error. Such is a common method the Hero uses to resolve such problems.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 6</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I may not be a Hero, but I will not wait and watch the world burn. I will not take comfort in the knowledge that the goddesses will send someone else to save us. It may not be something I was chosen for, but I will make my own path. I will break the cycle. And I will show this world that anyone can save it, if they try.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 6</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">But I’d made a choice from the start. To fight. To try to save the world, even if no one else would. I wasn’t going to stop until I’d succeeded or given my very last breath.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 7</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">We’re all going to die anyway if we do nothing.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 9</span></p>

                <h2>Anthony Ryan: Fire Wings</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">Some men are fated to die young. Saving him wouldn’t have changed that. Fear followed him like the stink that follows a drunkard, the fear that had cracked his mind when he murdered his uncle, the kind of fear that never fades. Better he spare others the cowardice that would surely have claimed him in battle.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 3: The Eyrie</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Disgrace is reserved for those of us who actually engage with the world.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 3: The Eyrie</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Every battle fought by a sentinel takes place in the air. The fear of falling is ingrained in every one of us, as well it should be, but to fight from a greatwing’s back requires that you master that fear. Your path lies before you. Built here and abandoned centuries ago by hands unknown. The thorn bushes we planted ourselves, a reminder to fledglings that falling has consequences.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 4: Fledglings</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Don’t take the leap, boy. If the birds don’t take to you, there’s nothing you can do. Best climb down and seek your honour elsewhere.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 5: Stielbek</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">A death suffered in search of honour is itself honourable.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 7: The Leap</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I’ve seen too many friends die, Shamil. Stood and watched and did nothing as they were led to the gallows, one by one. All my friends. Girls I laughed with when we played as children, gossiped with as we grew older. Boys I bickered with constantly and, as childhood faded, would sometimes kiss, only to bicker even more.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 8: The Voice Awakened</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">As long as there is malice in the world, so will the Voice contrive to persist.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 8: The Voice Awakened</span></p>

            <article>
                <h2>Anthony Ryan: City of Songs</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">To seek truth you must first understand its nature. For truth is not stone, it is water, It flows and ebbs according to channel and tide, It freezes into the illusory permanence of ice, It is moulded into storms and waves that can shatter whole nations, But always, as water remains water, truth remains truth.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Sadly, a confusion of names is inevitable when one hunts for legends.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">And memorisation is an empty skill, since memory without insight is like a knife without an edge.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">It’s the imprisoned spirit of a creature crafted from pure malice. It exists to cause mischief and misery and wishes you to be its instrument. The voice will become… easier to bear, in time, but you must be always on your guard. As the demon learns more about your character, the more cunning his schemes will become, the more insidious and seductive its suggestions. To carry a demon-cursed blade is to be forever burdened by the worst temptations.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">We are all creations. One way or another. And life is still life, regardless of the vessel that carries it.</span></p>                
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Anthony Ryan: To Blackfyre Keep</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">To love fiercely and not be loved in return is a more terrible curse than anything a demon could conjure.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">It would be best to get solid walls betwixt us and the wilds before investigating further. It’s always best to look to your own defence before sending forth scouts.</span> <span class="quote">Nothing stands forever. Live long enough and you get to witness once-great statues and temples fall to dust.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Always best to strike when the prey is distracted.</span></p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Anthony Ryan: Scarlet Ziggurat</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">For a slave is still a slave, even if he carries a sword.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">You never do anything without it serving some hidden purpose.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Power is at the heart of its nature, and power always recognises power.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">A web of enchantments that keep it in being, unspoiled and untroubled by the passage of time.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Guyime had once prided himself on never having run from a battle. However, many years roving the Five Seas as a cursed vagabond had taught him that pride can be as deadly as the most toxic poison.</span></p>

                <h2>Brandon Sanderson: SunReach</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">The day the delver came, I stood staring up at the stars.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">We worked well as a group, though we didn’t fly together regularly. Before I joined the DDF, I hadn’t understood the mentality that pushed people to fight as one, to keep doing so even as their friends died around them. I’d never felt that violence was the best way to solve problems, though I understood that violence was the only solution that kept us alive when the Krell kept trying to bomb us out of existence. Still, I’d found the rhetoric about glory disturbing, the way the National Assembly seemed to justify anything they wanted by saying it would help us fight the Krell. I had thought pilots were sheep. Skilled, determined, well-respected sheep who did what they were driven to do because they didn’t know any better.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Without the ability to communicate, we couldn’t work together as a flight. We’d end up scattered across the battlefield. Good pilots are good communicators.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I knew if we didn’t figure out how to change the course of the war soon, humanity wasn’t going to survive.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I knew my people. We didn’t trust peace any more than Alanik did. In fact, I was afraid we’d never be willing to set down our weapons. A wasteland could feel more comfortable than a paradise, if that was what you were used to. Though I agreed with the Disputers who yearned for peace, I didn’t know that I would be able to trust it. </span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">A silent fool is a stealthy fool.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I wasn’t Spensa. I didn’t enjoy running headlong into danger and figuring things out as I went along. But I also wasn’t going to let my entire planet be destroyed because I wasn’t willing to do what needed to be done. I was a pilot. I signed up for this. I was going to do the best I could to make sure that as many people came out of this alive as possible, even if I wasn’t among them. </span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I could never guarantee that I was going to return from any mission, much less that I could keep anyone else safe. </span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">It wasn’t enough to survive for survival’s sake. I wanted to live. I leaned in and kissed him, slowly and tenderly, like we had all the time in the world. And by the stars, I hoped we did.</span></p>

                <h2>Brandon Sanderson: ReDawn</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">Cooperation is not evil, Alanik. It depends entirely upon who you are cooperating with.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">We had to be open-minded about the customs of other species if we wanted them to be open-minded about ours.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">A good spy always paid attention to detail.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">A good spy was levelheaded, measuring her reactions.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Like the Saint says, whenever you get there, there you are.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I can see the assembly considering it though. Believing that trading a couple of lives to end the war would be an acceptable sacrifice. Risking a few to save so many.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Sometimes you have to do the right thing, Jorgen. Even if Command says to do something else.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">We need it to fight them. Because we don’t want to be under their control. Because we’re not ‘lesser.’ We’re intelligent, and we have a right to direct our own lives and our own future. We’re not trying to take over from the Superiority. We only want to exist without their interference and their…judgment.</span></p>

                <h2>Brandon Sanderson: Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">I don’t destroy things, I thought. I break them. They’re still there when I’m finished, they just don’t work right anymore.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 1</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Words like meaningful and thoughtful are other good clues.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 4</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">A clever person can make anything turn to his advantage, no matter how much a disadvantage it may seem at first.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 6</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">People go along with what they’re told. Even intelligent people believe what they read and hear, assuming they’re given no reason to question.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 8</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Hooks and cliffhangers belong only at the ends of chapters. That way, the reader moves on directly to the next page—where, thankfully, they can read more of the story without having to suffer some sort of mindless interruption.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 10</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Some people assume that authors write books because we have vivid imaginations and want to share our vision. Other people assume that authors write because we are bursting with stories, and therefore must scribble those stories down in moments of creative propondidty. Both groups of people are completely wrong. Authors write books for one, and only one, reason: because we like to torture people.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 11</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Many people just don’t know the things they need to know. Some ignore the truth; others never understand it.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 15</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I’m not trying to abandon you. We have a lot of work to do, you and I. However, you need to go back and spend some time with those who have loved you. You need to make your peace with them if you’re ever going to understand yourself well enough to help us win this war.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 20</span></p>

                <h2>Brandon Sanderson: Tress of the Emerald Sea</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">A terrible idea executed brilliantly has to be better than a brilliant idea executed terribly.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">An expertly forged sword crafted with love, dedication, and sweat by a smith so that someday you could do the most ugly things possible in the most beautiful of ways.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Danger doesn’t make a thing less beautiful—in fact, there’s a magnifying influence. Like how a candle seems brightest on the darkest night. Deadly beauty is the starkest variety. And you will never find a murderess more intoxicating, more entrancing, than the sea.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Whenever one does discover a moment of joy, beauty enters the world. Human beings, we can’t create energy; we can only harness it. We can’t create matter; we can only shape it. We can’t even create life; we can only nurture it. But we can create light. This is one of the ways. The effervescence of purpose discovered.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Worry has weight, and is an infinitely renewable resource. One might say worries are the only things you can make heavier simply by thinking about them.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Being one step from death. Most people never live, Tress, because they’re afraid of losing the years they have left…years that also will be spent not living. The irony of a cautious existence.</span> <span class="quote">You’re wrong. Plenty of ordinary people live meaningful, interesting lives without needing someone like you pushing them. You shouldn’t be so callous about killing good people.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I don’t think things were really better though. We just remember it that way because it’s comforting.</span> <span class="quote">And because we couldn’t see the troubles. Maybe we didn’t want to see them. When you’re young, there’s always someone else to deal with the problems.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Unfortunately, sympathy is not a valve, to be turned off when it starts to flood the yard. Indeed, the path to a life without empathy is a long and painful one, full of bartered humanity sold at a steep discount.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">If bravery is the wind that makes us soar like kites, fear is the string that keeps us from going too far. We need it, but the thing is, our heritage taught us to fear some of the wrong things.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Certain individual humans, like certain sausages, break this convention. While neither larger group is collectively terrifying, they contain remarkable individuals that absolutely should frighten you. The more you learn about these individuals, the more worried you should become. But for humans at large, knowledge usually equates to empathy, and empathy leads to understanding.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">The part the stories leave out, is everything that comes before. You see, I’ve discovered that it’s all right to need help. So long as you’ve lived your life as the kind of person who deserves to be rescued.</span></p>

                <h2>Brandon Sanderson: The Frugal Wizard's Handbook for Surviving Mediveal England</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">Zero stars. Would rather have a conversation with a corpse. It wouldn’t glare at me the entire time. Would probably listen better too.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 4</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">You came here imitating a messenger. You can’t get mad when someone treats you like one.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 7</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">New times are coming, Thegn. New… ways of doing things.</span> <span class="quote">New times? Those come whether we want them to or not. And we shall bear them as we bear the changing of seasons— which bring friends and foes, men and spirits.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 7</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">The more I’ve studied history, the more I’ve realized that grand achievements aren’t so much about aptitude as about timing. Just as nature abhors a vacuum, history will fill important roles with the people it has available. (…) Your life isn’t unremarkable. You are merely living in the wrong time. Find your Perfect Dimension ™. Embrace your destiny— whether it be to bring Promethean light or exert relentless domination— and travel the dimensions. Become a wizard.</span> <span class="location">You Are a Wizard</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">It was a reasonable plan. How do you deal with someone who has mystical powers? Get backup, and jump him with the element of surprise. Unfortunately, they wouldn’t stop to sleep.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 11</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">A god knows your heart before you give him offerings and prayers. Still, the mortal must say the words and make the actions. Do not question, Ealstan. I judge your knowledge.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 13</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I’m so tired of lying. Of always being worried...</span> <span class="quote">Of never staying in one place too long, because you’re afraid it will catch up to you. Of being worried that each person you pass is someone you stole from. Of never sleeping except when you have to, because even your friends are… the kinds of people you don’t sleep easily around.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 18</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">The past is a brutal place, my friend. You can change that. But first, you must tame it.</span> <span class="location">How to Be a Wizard</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">You are something special. Here. Now. That is what matters. So what if your knowledge is common among your kind? It is rare here. Perhaps every magus sent by Ahura Mazda to teach, instruct, and protect is like you. Simply someone who knows a little more— a little better— than everyone else.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 23</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Life isn’t like the craps table, where the next roll has the same chance of winning as the last one. In real life, you lose a little— and that makes you wonder if you deserve to lose. You get nervous, make mistakes, overcompensate. That makes you lose more, then it compounds. Eventually, you’re so far gone...</span> <span class="location">Chapter 29</span></p>

                <h2>Brian McClellan: Promise of Blood</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">A king’s pride doesn’t fill the people’s bellies.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I did this for me. And I did this for Adro. So that Manhouch wouldn’t sign us all into slavery to the Kez with the Accords. I did it because those grumbling students of philosophy at the university only play at rebellion. The age of kings is dead, Adamat, and I have killed it.</span></p>

                <p><span class="quote">The world shrinking down about a raw core of parsible entities. The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. Colors. The names of birds. Things to eat. Finally the names of things one believed to be true. More fragile than he would have thought. How much was gone already? The sacred idiom shorn of its referents and so of its reality. Drawing down like something trying to preserve heat. In time to wink out forever.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Maybe you should always be on the lookout. If trouble comes when you least expect it then maybe the thing to do is to always expect it.</span></p>

We are here because lies are a sickness. A plague infecting our peoples. Across the Empire the ease of deception weakens once great nations. Why fight? Imperial food, shelter, and medicine are so easy. We just have to agree to never question. The old ways were savage, right? Forget who we were, sell our children’s futures, and follow it.

Life becomes very simple at that point; you will do what you are trying to do, or die in the attempt, and it does not really matter much which.</span></p>

                <p><span class="quote">My love was entirely possessive. When you love a person, you are expected to give them their freedom, but when you love a monster, you keep it caged. A monster can’t love you back, so there’s none of the guilt of a reciprocal relationship. You’re already subjugated. You’re already holding yourself captive in a cruel way, so you justify whatever unusual bonds you level in return.</span> <span class="location">III. Captor</span></p>

                <p><span class="quote">We were mercenaries, not heroes. Wars almost always end with a good old-fashioned massacre, whether by steel or by spell.</span> <span class="location">And the Walls Came Down</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">You want to talk about my “pretences at nobility”? Let me tell you, sister, only rich lordlings and sublime obliviates are stupid enough to believe a slave can desire her oppressors any more than a man dying of thirst desires a glass of water!</span> <span class="location">Necessary Cruelties</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">My old mentor used to insist that you should always find something nice to say about people, even when they’re planning to kill you.</span> <span class="location">The Hanged Man</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I’d never believed that one way to die was any better than another. There are gradations of pain, of course, and levels of personal desecration, which is its own type of pain, I suppose – but death? Death itself is nothing but a final tick of the clock wound inside us by our unwitting mothers the moment they gave birth, counting down from our first breath to our last. There are no ‘good’ or ‘bad’ ways to leave this Mortal realm. We simply... end.</span> <span class="location">A Nasty Way to Die</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">There are no noble quests for people like us, Cade! Half the world wants us dead for one spiritual crime or another, while the half who keep us alive and well fed do so only as long as we blow stuff up for them. Well, a lot of people deserve to get blown up. That’s where we come in. Everybody works for somebody, and that somebody is usually an arsehole!</span> <span class="location">The Canal</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">My dear, there is not one of us whose nature refutes the potential for goodness. None whom the world can deny the chance for redemption, and not a single one of us unworthy of love.</span> <span class="location">The Handsome Rat</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">To battle, comrades – in victory or in death do we inscribe our names upon the pages of history!</span> <span class="location">The Handsome Rat</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">That the root of humanity’s downfall was not evil, lust, greed or any of the usual sins, but simply hubris: that unique mixture of arrogance, conceit and a distinct lack of foresight of which only human beings are truly capable. Indeed, some have developed it into a fine art.</span> <span class="location">The Price and the Prize</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">You can’t do this job if you see others only as better or worse versions of yourself. Human beings are complicated. Nuanced.</span> <span class="quote">I know the world isn’t black and white. I can see shades of grey as well as you or anyone else.</span> <span class="quote">Colours, boy: it’s the infinite colours, all those wondrous variations of our humanity, that defy our judgement, that challenge the very idea of the law. Those colours will overwhelm your senses, Cade, if you can’t come to grips with them.</span> <span class="location">The Price and the Prize</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I advise you look away, even if the justiciars in question are about to chop your head off with their swords. Trust me, it’ll be easier that way.</span> <span class="location">I Hate Reunions</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I’m a vile, treasonous outcast who betrayed every single one of our teachings. I wage war for money, consort with diabolics for my spells and have been known to pleasure myself on holy days. But at least I’m not a fucking glorified bouncer working some petty princeling’s whoreship.</span> <span class="location">I Hate Reunions</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I could admit to myself that part of me had been craving a confrontation with the justiciars – a fair fight, or as near to it as someone like me would ever get. Maybe I’d always hoped that when my time came, I’d go out in a blaze of ingloriousness, free from my own past, fighting alongside trusted friends.</span> <span class="location">The Breakout</span></p>

                <p><span class="quote">I’m sick and tired of listening to Mortals moan on and on about how vile we Infernals are, how we tempt you in times of need and then steal your souls. Fuck me, you actually use the name of our realm as a synonym for evil! How would you like it if we used the word Mortal to mean “useless piece of shit who blames all their problems on other people because they’re too lazy to sort out their own wasted life”?</span> <span class="location">Walks in the Dark</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">You have to look beyond the old divisions, the old fights. The game changed while the rest of us weren’t paying attention. The players aren’t who we think they are.</span> <span class="location">Comrades</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">And here’s a lesson worth remembering: when a diabolic hugs you and tells you they love you? Maybe check your pockets immediately afterwards.</span> <span class="location">A Deal’s a Deal</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Tenebris held out a fist towards me, palm up, then raised his middle finger. He did that often when our negotiations had come to an end. I think it must be a gesture of farewell among his people.</span> <span class="location">A Deal’s a Deal</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Nothing good ever comes from talking to your enemies before a battle. I don’t know why people waste the time and effort. Tradition, I suppose.</span> <span class="location">Parlay</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">I took another drink of the wine. Sometimes a bad taste in your mouth makes some things easier to say.</span> <span class="location">The Thunder</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Given you’ve just declared victory, Cade, I’m curious why you’re scowling like that.</span> <span class="quote">Because winning and surviving aren’t the same thing. They’ve given us the tools to destroy the gates, Corrigan, but not to escape the battle. They’re expecting us to win, but not live.</span> <span class="location">The Thunder</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">It’s got nothing to do with morality or decency or any other human concern. A soul that realises it’s been deceived fights to hold itself together, even in the Infernal plane. Those who gave up their souls in the full knowledge of what it would mean deliver purer ecclesiasm.</span> <span class="location">The Girl and the Boy</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Life is a river of filth, just like this sewer. You either go with the current and enjoy the ride as long as you can, or you push against it and drown in shit.</span> <span class="location">Complications</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">When the slave displeases the master, the master punishes them neither for convenience nor justice, but as a warning to others that disobedience comes with a price.</span> <span class="location">The Thunderer’s Choice</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">The seven of us had started out with nothing in common. Hell, we could barely tolerate each other’s company most of the time. But in that instant, as we abandoned all our petty and selfish impulses so that we could share in one tragic, glorious act of defiance... we became our own army, our own family.</span> <span class="location">The Gates Within</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Behold your valiant hero: a self-important, sermonising poser who’d never stoop to getting down in the mud where the real fight’s about to start because he might have to get his hands dirty and that would make him ‘no better than the bad guys’.</span> <span class="location">Real Heroes Don’t Name Their Swords</span></p>

                <h2>T. Kingfisher: The Seventh Bride</h2>
                <p><span class="quote">Young women married much older men all the time. It happened a lot. Childbearing was dangerous business, and there were a lot of widowers out there. There was nothing unusual about it.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 3</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Magic didn’t make you a bad person, but it didn’t necessarily make you a good one, either. People got antsy when you had a power they didn’t have.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 4</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">As if, by pretending everything was perfectly normal, it would make things perfectly normal. ‘It won’t change anything, pretending everything’s all normal.’</span> <span class="location">Chapter 4</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">It’s all very well to cry for any number of reasons, including the fact that sometimes you simply need a good cry. And since a lot of the reasons for crying occur largely in your head— which is not to say that they’re not real— it actually helps, because after five or ten minutes sobbing into a pillow, the world may not be any better, but at least you don’t feel quite so much like crying. The red hollow under your breastbone is emptied out, and things can be faced with more resolution. (And a swollen nose and itchy eyes, of course, but you can’t have everything.)</span> <span class="location">Chapter 6</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Roses have thorns... That’s the price of roses. When you start to forget that, that’s when things go wrong.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 8</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">It is sometimes easier to be punished for something than it is to be a victim of random cruelty.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 20</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">Sometimes people talk so they don’t have to say anything,” she said dryly. It’s not nice to call them out on it.</span> <span class="location">Chapter 20</span></p>
